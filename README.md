Master Data Management

As a part of master data management, you can entry modify data accordingly business rules. As a part of this system you can mange such as 
Outlet Configure, Product/Item, Product Group, Product Category, Supplier, General Configuration, SD & VAT Config, Retail Unit Config, Delivery type, Warehouse configure.

Real-time inventory tracking
This is the number one, absolute basic requirement of an inventory management software system. Your software must show you exactly what you have, and where – and it needs to reflect in real-time any stock movements or allocations in your company. That means:
•	Sales orders are reflected in your stock position. So you don’t sell the same thing twice, or sell stock you can’t deliver
•	Inbound goods are reflected in your inventory management software as soon as they’re scanned at the warehouse.
•	Warehouse transfers show up in real time.
•	Production reserves components if you’re a manufacturer. So you don’t start a new assembly run only to find that half your parts were used up on another job.
•	Consignment stock is tracked by your system, even if it’s held in someone else’s store.

Barcode scanning
Efficient warehouses track goods in and out electronically, with barcode scanning the most popular method. You’ll typical use barcode readers for:
•	Receipting Purchase Orders.
•	Stock Counts.
•	Sales Shipments.
So ensure your inventory management software supports 1D barcode readers, and can generate its own barcodes for printable labels.
Batch tracking 
Batch tracking keeps you on top of batches of stock so you can monitor things like expiry dates, using up goods before they become worthless. It’s also critical for manufacturers who need robust traceability systems in the event of a product recall.

Real-time inventory value
While warehouse managers and operations care about what stock they have and where it is, the finance team needs to know how much it’s worth.
A good inventory management system therefore needs to update – in real time – whatever accounting software you use. That means you’ll want:
•	Accurate inventory values that account for variations in the price or volume of your purchases.
•	A live view of inventory value by warehouse, region and country.
•	Multi-currency support if you buy and / or sell in multiple countries.
•	The ability to accurately track variable inventory costs like courier fees or production wastage.
•	The ability to group products to give a more granular view of Cost of Good Sold (Cogs).
•	A live view of the profit margin on your products according to the sales channel and location and that accounts for any variable costs.

Requisition Purchase management & supplier management
A key business efficiency you unlock by having proper inventory management software is gaining control of your purchasing. Naturally, when you know exactly what you have, what it’s worth and where it is, you’re in a far better position when it comes to buying more (or not buying more needlessly, as the case may be).
But you must make sure that you don’t waste time – and make mistakes – manually transferring your inventory data into your purchasing process, or endlessly copy-and-pasting your supplier details.
By this system you will be able to manage below functionality: 
Requisition & Issue, General Requisition, Outlet Requisition, Requisition List, Requisition Print, Issue, Issue List, Purchase Requisition, PR Create, PR List, PO Print, Purchase Order, PO Create, PO List, PO Print, Challan, Challan Create, Chalan List, Challan Print, Quality Assurance, QC Create, QC List, Receive, Return, Adjust
Reorder points & low stock alerts
There’s not much point knowing exactly what stock you have and where if that doesn’t prevent you running out. Your inventory management software therefore needs functionality around setting automatic alerts when important stock is running low – and the ability to quickly generate a purchase order off the back of that alert.
For stock management at scale you’ll want the ability to generate a reorder report that lists everything that needs reordering so you can do your purchasing in one fell swoop.
